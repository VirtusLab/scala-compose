```

To run compile command from `scala-compose` module:

```

#### Generate a standalone JVM launcher

./mill -i show scala-compose.standaloneLauncher
```

#### Generate a native launcher

```bash
./mill -i show scala-compose.nativeImage
```

Scala CLI is a command-line tool to interact with the Scala language. It lets you compile, run, test, and package your
Scala code. (and more!) It shares some similarities with build tools, but it doesn't aim at supporting multi-module
projects, nor to be extended via a task system.

As of [SIP-46](https://github.com/scala/improvement-proposals/pull/46), Scala CLI has been accepted as the new `scala`
command and is currently in the experimental phase. If you want to try it out, check for more
details [here](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/docs/reference/scala-command/).
